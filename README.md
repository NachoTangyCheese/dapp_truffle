	* Solidity Contract Tests - http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/solidity-tests

* Interaction with Contracts - http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/contracts

	* 'call' (READ DATA) - Reading Data from Ethereum Network
		* Definition:
			* Calls do not change state of network
			* Calls execute code on network but no data is permanently changed
			* Calls read data
			* Calls are free to run
			* Calls when used to execute a contract function allow receiving the return value immediately
	
	* 'transaction' (WRITE DATA) - Writing Data to Ethereum Network
		* Definition:
			* Transactions change state of network
			* Transactions write/change data
			* Transactions cost Ether to run (aka 'gas') 
			* Transactions take time to process
			* Transactions only return Transaction ID, but cannot receive functions return value since transaction not processed immediately
		* Examples
			* Example (Simple): Sending Ether between accounts
			* Example (Complex): 
				* Executing Contract function (i.e. via a transaction)
				* Adding New Contract to network 

	* Truffle Contract Abstraction (i.e. [truffle-contract](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract))
		* Definition
			* Wrapper code (over engines running under the hood) for interaction with Ethereum Contracts from JavaScript
		* Example
			* MetaCoin.sol
				* 3x functions exist (i.e. sendCoin, getBalanceInEth, and getBalance)
				* Each function executable as either `transaction` or `call`


* Contract and Migration Development

	* Helper Methods to Scaffold New Contracts, Migrations, and Tests for Contracts http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/commands#networks
		```
		truffle create contract MyContract
		truffle create migration MyContract
		truffle create test MyTest
		```

	* Execute a JavaScript file in Truffle environment, and include web3, and set the default provider based on the `network` argument specified, and includes contracts as global objects whilst executing script 
		```
		truffle exec /path/to/my/script.js --network <name>
		```

* Publishing Smart Contract Package to EthPM (Ethereum Package Registry)that is integrated into Truffle 
	
	* References:
		* http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/packages-ethpm
		* http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/networks

	* Note: 
		* EthPM currently exists on Ropsten test network
		* List of existing Ethereum Packages https://www.ethpm.com/registry/packages

	* Show Networks `truffle networks`
		* Shows deployed addresses of all contracts on all networks

	* Pre-Publish Cleaning - `truffle networks --clean`
	(removes network artifacts not associated with named network that not want published)

	* Publish package to Ethereum Package Registry `truffle publish` (all parameters pull from project config file)

* Project Structure

	* app/
		* Usage - App files by default (JS, styles)
	
	* build/contracts
		* Usage - Artifacts of compilation for deployment. 

	* build/
		* References
			* truffle.js comments
		* Options	- configured in `truffle.js`
			* Default Builder - 
				* Important Note: in Truffle >v3.0 the Default Builder is in a separate module called truffle-default-builder. Refer to section "Usage in Truffle 3.0" at https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-default-builder/tree/master
				* Advantages
					* Automatically bootstraps app front-end in browser and imports compiled and deployed contract artifacts and information and Ethereum client config.
					* Control over organisation of files and folders
					* Automatically includes recommended dependencies including:
						* web3 - https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/tree/master
						* Ether Pudding (Contract Packager) - https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-artifactor
						* ES6 and React.js built-in
						* Sass
						* UglyifyJS 
				* Disadvantages
					* No support for ES2015 `import` or CommonJS `require`
					* Poor integration with other build systems like Webpack
			* Custom Builder
				* Advantages
				* Disadvantages

	* contracts/
		* Usage - Truffle expects to finds solidity contracts
		* Contents
			* Solidity Contract file http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html
			* Solidity Library file http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#libraries
			* Migrations Contract
				* About - Deploy this contract in first migration to use Migrations Feature. Deploy libraries before contracts
		* Examples
			* Default Project
				* MetaCoin
					* About - Demo app called MetaCoin which is a coin-like contract that acts like alt-coin built inside Ethereum
					* Limitations 
						* Not standards compatible or able to talk to other coin/contracts
					* Opportunities - Convert to standards compatible https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens

	* migrations/
		* Usage 
			* Scriptable deployment files for staging and deployment of contracts to Ethereum network. New migration scripts used to further evolve project on the blockchain
			* Deploy the Migrations Contract in the first migration file
			* Deployer used to stage deployment tasks synchronously or alternatively using Promise chain
			* Deploy libraries before contracts
			* Link libraries to contracts with `deployer.link` and `deployer.autolink`
			* Execute script relative to migrations file, to be run with `truffle exec` as part of deployment with `deployer.exec`
			* Option to conditionallly run deployment tasks depending on Network
		* References
			* http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/migrations
	
	* test/
		* Usage - Test files for testing app and contracts
	
	* truffle.js
		* Main Truffle config file.

* QUESTIONS
	* Why does passing `--secure false` to `testrpc` result in error `Error: could not unlock signer account` even if I've already unlocked accounts to be generated

* TODO
	* [X] - Fix functionality of `truffle build` to resolve error. Await response from question posted in Truffle forum https://gitter.im/ConsenSys/truffle
		```
		Error building:

		Build configuration can no longer be specified as an object. Please see our documentation for an updated list of supported build configurations.

		Build failed. See above.
